STEPS TO CREATE THE JS_QUIZ

CREATE A BASIC HTML STRUCTURE TO FOLLOW AND FILL WITH JAVASCRIPT AND CSS
-I created 10 questions that were then loaded on slides
-The slides could be navigated backwards and forwards with separate buttons
-Each question had radio buttons to check for the correct answers 
-The Css was formated by me  

CREATE A JAVASCRIPT FUNCTION THAT WILL KEEP TIME
-I created a javascript countdown that begins upon page load and continues for 20 seconds
-Upon 20 seconds, text appears saying 'Quiz is over!' and the 'Submit' button is automattically clicked to submit the quiz as is
-The User then sees how many points they recieved out of 10 at the bottom.

CREATE MULTIPLE QUESTIONS TO ANSWER
-Questions were created through research

TALLY UP THE CORRECT ANSWERS TO EQUAL A HIGH SCORE
-I ran out of time, but will revisit this to make additional edits
